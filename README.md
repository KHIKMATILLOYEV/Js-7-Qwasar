## Welcome to the last quest! 
In this task, we will dive into the wonderful world of data structures and solve it with the help of one of the important code fragments related to the use of correct data structures.

## What is a data structure?
A data structure is an organized way of storing and managing data in a computer. An array is one of the data structures, but not the only one. There are many other data structures such as hash tables, queues, stacks, linked lists, trees, etc. ðŸ˜„

Each of these data structures can perform different operations with speed and memory usage.

For example, an array is faster to search for elements (and even faster if the array is sorted), while a connected list is easier to insert elements in the middle of the list.

For this quest, you will need to master working with arrays (sometimes called dictionaries or hashes).
